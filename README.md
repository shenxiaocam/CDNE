Network Together: Node Classification via Cross-Network Deep Network Embedding
====
This repository contains the author's implementation in Matlab for the paper "Network Together: Node Classification via Cross-Network Deep Network Embedding".


Codes: 
====
**"source_SAE.m"** is the function of **SAE_s** which learns low-dimensional node vector representations for source network


**"target_SAE.m"** is the function of **SAE_t** which learns low-dimensional node vector representations for target network


**“test_CDNE_Blog.m”** is an example case of cross-network node classification from Blog1 to Blog2


**“test_CDNE_DBLP.m”** is an example case of cross-network node classification from citationv1 to dblpv7
